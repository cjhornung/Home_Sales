# Home_Sales
In this challenge, I used SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. 

## Methodology: 
- Spark to create temporary views
- Partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and 
- Verify that the table has been uncached.

## Results:
A Spark DataFrame is created from the dataset:

A temporary table of the original DataFrame is created:

A query is written that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, for a four-bedroom house that was sold in each year:

A query is written that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, of a home that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms:

A query is written that returns the average price of a home with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet for each year built rounded to two decimal places:

A query is written that returns the view rating for the average price for homes that are greater than or equal to $350,000, rounded to two decimal places:

A cache of the temporary "home_sales" table is created and validated:

The query from step 6 is run on the cached temporary table, and the run time is computed:

A partition of the home sales dataset by the "date_built" field is created, and the formatted parquet data is read:

A temporary table of the parquet data is created:

The query from step 6 is run on the parquet temporary table, and the run time is computed:

The "home_sales" temporary table is uncached and verified:
